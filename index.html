	<h1>For the Love of Dogs</h1>
		<p>I have been a dog lover all my life. As a child we had several dogs. Mostly “muts” but each one had its own personality and were my best friend. From large Shepherd mixes to small Cocker Spaniels and everything in between. It was because of these unique experiences I had as a child that I wanted to have my own dog as an adult. A dog that would fetch, swim, run and play; I was always researching to find the perfect dog for me. As it turns out I found several dogs that made great pets. All of these breeds were very different and all extremely lovable. It also turns out, the dogs I love tend to be the dogs others don’t.</p>
